  <h2>Installation and updates</h2>
  <p>Some browsers, including Safari on iOS or new Edge on Windows, may install web apps. Select install (commonly named as "add to the home screen" on mobile) to install it.</p>

  <p><strong>The reader cannot guarantee that added files will not be cleaned up. Do not use the reader as a place to store or back up files.</strong></p>
  <p>Whenever you launch this application, with network connection available, the reader checks for and downloads the updated version. And the newer version will be used next time you launch application. If you don't want automatic updates, you'll need to fork or deploy this project yourself.</p>
  <p>You may also use this reader without installation. Installing may help to hide UI elements such as address bar and provide offline use.</p>

  <p>Font settings allow you to browse and select font files. Supported font types may vary from browser to browser. Most browsers would support <code>.ttf</code>, <code>.otf</code> files.</p>
  <p>Language tags are used to prompt the language of the article to browser. The setting may affect the wrapping of text and different font selections.</p>
  <p>Pre-processing is performed only once when files are added. Files already added are not affected by this option.</p>
